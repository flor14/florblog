<h2>RStudio Certification</h2>
<p>I recently became certified as a RStudio Tidyverse <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/">Instructor</a>. To pass the certification there are two exams. In this post, I am going to share a 15 minute class that I prepared to as part of the teaching exam.</p>

<p>I use loops frequently for my postdoc as I need to automate tasks. That is why I decided to teach two specific examples of iteration using functions in <code>purrr</code> package.
I find that these examples are motivating for students as these functions offer a simple way to get a lot of work done:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read a group of files with the same extension and get a dataframe using <code>map_df()</code></p></li>
<li><p>Generate Rmarkdown reports from a list of parameters automatically with <code>pwalk()</code></p></li>
</ul>

<div id="who-is-the-class-for" class="section level2">
<h2>Who is the class for?</h2>
<p>This class is part of three weeks long data analysis course for graduate students without any previous training in programming.<br />
The 15 minutes are part of the last class of the course. The students already have learned basic topics as visualization, data manipulation, RMarkdown, and iteration.</p>

<div id="some-considerations" class="section level2">
<h2>Some considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To answer the the exercises in ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Practice‚Äù you need concepts that were explained in previous classes. Specially these 15 minutes should be teach after <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html">iteration</a> and <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html"><code>Rmarkdown</code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not necessary to use Xaringan for the certification slides.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important that you practice your class keeping track of how long it lasts.</p></li>
</ul>
