summary: "Slides modified from the Tidyverse Certified Instructor Training"
---

I recently took two exams and certified as a [Tidyverse instructor](). For the teaching exam I had to prepare 15 minutes of a class of my choice.

## What to teach about?
I decided to explain something that I find interesting to teach.
For my work the use of loops is extremely necessary and vital to finish my PhD. However I always thought that the examples in the books do not show the initial students all the work that you can save by automating tasks.

## purrr
I decided to choose two functions from the `purrr` package that allow, by writing little code, to automate two tasks that can be very useful. On the one hand read a group of files with the same extension and obtain a dataframe using `map_df()` and on the other hand generate Rmarkdown reports automatically with `pwalk()`

## Files

[Slides]()

[Live coding 1 - `map_df()`]()

[Live coding 2 - report generation]()

Consideration: These 15 minutes are intended to be explained AFTER the `map()` and `walk()` families of functions. To solve the small practical parts I am assuming that iteration using the `purrr` package functions has already been explained.
