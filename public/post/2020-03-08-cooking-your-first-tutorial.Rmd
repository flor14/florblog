## Hello

Last year I helped to build some free online tutorials using Ines Montani Framework. After one busy year that included the end of my PhD finally I have some time to make a contribution to the community about how to build these tutorials.

[Here](https://github.com/flor14/tutorials) you have some examples of tutorials created with this framework. 

### Why to use Ines Montani framework?

1- [Ted Laderas](https://twitter.com/tladeras) has written some key *"pros and cons"* of using this framework in the [post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/r-bootcamp/) in the RStudio education blog explaining  the difference between Ines' framework with *learnr* tutorial package. 

2 - Ines Montani documentation is really detailed. If you find problems in building the tutorial I strongly suggest you came back to [her repo](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r). 

> Do you teach a class in R and have a course that want to convert to a tuturial? A presential course it is not exactly the same as a online tutorial for example in the book [Teaching Tech Together, Greg Wilson](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:online). Will do you have to adapt your material previously?

### Recipe for an online tutorial üìù
#### 1. **Ingredients**

First of all you have to divide your course into **chapters**. As a general rule there are 4 or 5 chapters. 

###### The chapters can have:

* Slides with explanatory text associated 

* Codeblock exercises 

* Multiple choise exercises

* Audio or video files

> You can use [decampr package](https://laderast.github.io/decampr/articles/from_scratch.html) to generate some of the basic file structures. ü§ñ 

#### 2. **Prepare a repository**

You should have an account on GitHub (it is free). If you do not know how to do this, please check this [webpage](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)

[The course starter R repository](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r) is on GitHub. You can get a copy using it as a [template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Have a look to the [repository structure](https://ines.github.io/course-starter-python/#repository-structure). In this example is for a python tutorial, but it is basically the same structure. 

> Remember that Ines Montani framework is available for [Python](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) too.

#### 3. **Custom elements** üì¶

###### **Slides with text**
* üìÅ **slides** folder 
  - The slides are markdown (.md) files. It is good idea to name the file according to the chapter number and order, for example **chapter2_01.md**.
  
  - *How is the structure of the slides file?* Ines described it [here](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r)
  
###### **Codeblock**
*  üìÅ **exercises** folder 
  - Each exercise file has an associated solution file (and a ideally a test file)
  - The names for each file should have the same reference number:
  
  ![The solutions and exercises are separated files, linked by the final number in the name of the file](https://res.cloudinary.com/flor/image/upload/v1585163873/tutorial2_hbfvio.png)
  


###### **Multiple choise exercises**

* üìÅ **chapters** folder 
  - There are not specific files for them, are generated inside each chapter file. 
  - Read more about them [in the documentation](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r)

  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to include a unique id to each multiple choise exercise!


###### **Audio and Video** 
 Detailed [here](https://ines.github.io/course-starter-python/#embedding-video-and-audio)
 
###### **Chapters** 
* üìÅ **chapters** folder 
  - Each chapter is a markdown (.md) file. 
  - Chapter structure: you should include the name of the slides, exercises and solution files. 
  

  ![In his tutorial Noam Ross decided to include a "references.md" with extra material](https://res.cloudinary.com/flor/image/upload/v1585062072/tutorial1_emry8n.png)

#### Do not forget üòÆ

- Customize the *meta.json* file with the information of your course.

- Add a profile picture and logo too! -> üìÅ **static** folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember include the logo in .svg format! You can convert a .png pr .jpg image to this format online


### 3. **Cooking!**üç≥

Have you added all your files to you repository? Now it is time to see if it works!
Remember to read the [Section: Setting up Binder](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r) and checking the file *install.R* -> üìÅ **binder** folder.

This can take a while! ‚è∞

Meanwhile you can start your account in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the deploy as [Ines did](), but this step could be skipped. Why to use netlify? [I found this blogpost of Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/) with an explanation. It is up to you!

#### 4. **Decoration** üçíüé®

- [Add a summary and a course description as introduction](https://ines.github.io/course-starter-python/#introduction-on-homepage)
- [Change logo size ](https://github.com/noamross/gams-in-r-course/blob/master/src/styles/index.module.sass) modifying *width* argument after *.logo*
- [Change the colors]() Modify *theme.sass*
- [Add a licence badge!](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) Look in the section "Add legal code" after each type of licence.

#### 5. **Something is missing** 

‚ö†Ô∏è Test are not fully developed yet! 

### Bon Appetite üçΩ!

Now you have your online tutorial ready to feed the community! 

You can make a pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/flor14/tutorials) that I am maintaining that collects all the courses generated with this material and other useful material to build your own course.


## Thanks

I want to thank Noam Ross, Julia Silge, Ines Montani and Ted Laderas for their kindness of deciding lo left the material of their courses for free.
