> Do you remember the first time you learned math in your life? Or history? I do not. But I remember my first steps programming. For self-taught adults like me, each step forward can feel like a great achievement. Each obstacle is in itself a learning opportunity. The idea of ​​this initial series of posts is to tell you about my first steps in the world of programming and give you some tools that can be useful to start.

Let me introduce myself: I have just finished my Ph.D. in biology and I am probably part of a phenomenon in extinction, something that being optimistic I call "the last generation graduated from a university in sciences without training in programming skills".

This story begins in 2014, with a student (me!) finishing her first year of Ph.D. and frustrated by not finding a good postgraduate computing course. I was not sure what I was looking for, but I had a lot of data and it was difficult to use Excel for my purposes. At that time I would have liked to know [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). It was only years later that Laura invited [Rayna](twitter.com/raynamharris) on her way to Buenos Aires to a [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/rladies-buenos-aires) meetup. There she presented this community that proposes free lessons designed specifically for those who do science learn [programming from scratch](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). If you are in this stage, I recommend you to approach this community, which is beginning to flourish in Latin America. In 2014 I hardly would have imagined that 4 years later I would be a certified instructor of the Carpentries, but that is another story.

I would never have thought about writing a blog either. And at this point of the story, [Laura](twitter.com/_lacion_ ) appeared, who will be a recurring character in this story:

![When would you start your blog? First, graduation. But after the defense of your thesis, I will remind you about this.](https://res.cloudinary.com/flor/image/upload/v1557272866/tesisTW_vx8kzd.png)

WARNING! Let’s difference learning R and learn programming using R as your first language. My experience refers to this last case, so some of these steps are more linked to start programming, that is, use coding in problem-solving than to learn R per se.


## ¿And now?
Now I am learning Python and finishing a course about computer engineering. I am actively trying to apply more reproducible practices in my workflows. Also, through this blog, I intend to leave code that I generate for my thesis for free.
