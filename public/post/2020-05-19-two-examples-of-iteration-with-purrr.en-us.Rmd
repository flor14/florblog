## Certification

I recently became certified as a R-Studio Tidyverse [instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/). To pass the certification there are two exams, one specific a subject (such as Tidyverse or Shiny) and another one for teaching.
In this blog I am going to share a 15 minute class that I prepared to pass the teaching exam.


## What to teach about?

I use loops frecquently in for my work. I decided to look for two specific examples of functions in `purrr` package that could be motivating for the students.

My two examples:

- Read a group of files with the same extension and get a dataframe using `map_df()`

- Generate Rmarkdown reports from a list of parameters automatically with `pwalk()`

## Important

* These 15 minutes are meant to be explained AFTER [loops and `purrr` package](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) and [`Rmarkdown` ](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html). In particular, to answer the parts of "Let's Practice" you need concepts that were explained before.

* It is not necessary to use Xaringan for the certification slides. I moved the original slides to Xaringan for this post and made a few changes. It is important that you practice your class keeping track of how long it lasts.

I hope you find it useful!
