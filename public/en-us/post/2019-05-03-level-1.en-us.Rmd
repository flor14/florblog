## How do I got there?
Using R for the first time with my own data, I decided to google a tutorial. My first steps were importing databases with the IDE of R-Studio, performing statistical tests, and writing down the results on a paper. Being a user of classic statistics software and Excel, the "Import data" button of the R-Studio IDE seemed intuitive. That is, towards something similar when using software with a friendly interface. The flow was more or less like this:

</center>

1. Import data: Button import data. *SIMILAR to EXCEL*.

</center>

2. Install and use a package. *NEW*.

</center>

3. Call a function of the package. *SIMILAR to EXCEL*, but R has its own "writing". For some functions I needed to install packages before.
4. Visualization. *NEW*. I had to write code to graph. I encouraged some simple graphics with plot () after googling how to do it.

</center>

5. Export data: *SIMILAR to EXCEL*. Copy the results from the R console to an Excel or Word table. If it was a graphic, it used "Export" in the "Plots" panel of R-Studio.

After some time getting results in a fluid way following this scheme, I felt comfortable. I think a lot of people who use R on their own are in this step, maybe forever, since it allows them to get results.
Listen to call [Yanina Saibene Bellini](www.twitter.com/yabellini) that people in this stage "use R (through [R-Studio](https://florencia.netlify.com/2019/05/hello-world-2-6.es-is /)) like a calculator ". I understand that there is something about touching buttons and choosing options that makes it more intuitive at first, but at the cost of decreasing the reproducibility of your workflow.

## Reflections
This is the point where the differences with Excel in terms of basic workflow are lowest. At the moment of wanting to import a dataset from R-Studio, there is a code preview of how this same action would be written in code. RStudio in this way helps you to start writing your own code. We will see later that this increases the reproducibility of your work.
Understanding that "R is not just another type of statistical software" came after several reflections.
First you have to understand the difference between using a programming language and a software with user interface. The latter is friendlier and more intuitive to use, but offers a number of limited options. In R, not having a user interface that limits my choices, appears the "blank sheet syndrome" (also known as "what now?"). This apparent disadvantage can also be considered a virtue: when you use R you are developing your own algorithm.

There are advantages to using code to write all the steps of my analysis because they allow me to make my workflow reproducible. The direct use of code enables releasing it in public repositories and being able to work collaboratively. This in itself is a paradigm shift in the way science is done today (quote).
When I heard the plenary talk of [Jenny Bryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIeCuzfHQ6A&feature=youtu.be) at [LatinR](latin-r.com) 2018, I was able to formalize in my head what It was what I was perceiving as novel.

## Recommendations
* Go find a tutorial on any of these topics is possible only if one knows that this functionality exists, hence being informed becomes essential. If you are in this stage I suggest you get closer to the community of R. Both the tweets under the hashtag #rstats (or #rstats-ES in Spanish), communities as the [user groups of R](https://renbaires.github.io/) and [R-Ladies ](rladies.org) offer free talks in friendly environments. I recommend you look at your country. It was at [R-Ladies] (www.rladies.org) where I learned about the existence of shiny packages, RMarkdown, blogdown, the possibility of web scraping, packages to generate maps, the Tidyverse, the use of control of versions like Git, and multiple other functionalities.
* Also participate in initiatives on Twitter under the hashtags #tidytuesday (or in Spanish #datosdemiercoles) allow learning from the experience of other users and advice from other users.
* Every error, warning! or difficulty that appears can be googled on the internet, various forums such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) are usually an exchange site between users of all the world. Also [Maelle](twitter.com/ma_salmon) has [this](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/22/wheretogethelp/) and [this other](https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/25/uptodate/) interesting posts about it.
