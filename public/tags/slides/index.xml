      <description>Hello!In February I will participate in a meetup of the R-Ladies chapter R-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes and the R user group R en el NEA. These groups represent the R users of Resistencia and Corrientes cities of Argentina.
The meetup consists of a workshop where attendees will learn to build their own apps. This material improves the one that I presented in an R-Ladies Buenos Aires meetup in 2017.
