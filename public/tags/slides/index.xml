      <description>RStudio CertificationI recently became certified as a RStudio Tidyverse Instructor. To pass the certification there are two exams. In this post, I am going to share a 15 minute class that I prepared to as part of the teaching exam.
What to teach about?I use loops frequently for my postdoc as I need to automate tasks. That is why I decided to teach two specific examples of iteration using functions in purrr package.</description>

      <description>Hello!In February I will participate in a meetup of the R-Ladies chapter R-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes and the R user group R en el NEA. These groups represent the R users in the cities of Resistencia and Corrientes, Argentina.
The meetup consists of a workshop where attendees learn to build their own apps. This material improves the one that I presented in an R-Ladies Buenos Aires meetup in 2017.</description>
