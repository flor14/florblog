      <description>MotivationI started to develop ShinyApps because of my research. The development of a ShinyApp for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.

I got valuable suggestions in the RStudio Community forum including a list of possible journals accepting ShinyApps, in the following thread.</description>
