      <description>MotivationI started to develop Shiny Apps because of my research. The development of a Shiny App for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.
Where to publish?After finishing the app, my first question was whether to publish the Shiny App. Should I include it as supplementary material of other paper or could be published as software itself?</description>

      <description>Hello!In February I will participate in a meetup of the R-Ladies chapter R-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes and the R user group R en el NEA. These groups represent the R users in the cities of Resistencia and Corrientes, Argentina.
The meetup consists of a workshop where attendees learn to build their own apps. This material improves the one that I presented in an R-Ladies Buenos Aires meetup in 2017.</description>
