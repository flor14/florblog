      <description>MotivationI started to develop Shiny Apps because of my research. The development of a Shiny App for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.
Where to publish?After finishing the app, my first question was whether to publish the Shiny App. Should I include it as supplementary material of other paper or could be published as software itself?</description>
