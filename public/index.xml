      <description>The aim of this post is to provide a route map highlighting the incredible resources available to generate your own tutorial and some considerations.
HelloLast year I helped to build some free online tutorials using Ines Montani Framework. After one busy year that included the end of my PhD finally I have some time to make a contribution to the community about how to build these tutorials.</description>

      <description>MotivationI started to develop Shiny Apps because of my research. The development of a Shiny App for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.
Where to publish?After finishing the app, my first question was whether to publish the Shiny App. Should I include it as supplementary material of other paper or could be published as software itself?</description>

      <description>Hello!In February I will participate in a meetup of the R-Ladies chapter R-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes and the R user group R en el NEA. These groups represent the R users of Resistencia and Corrientes cities of Argentina.
The meetup consists of a workshop where attendees will learn to build their own apps. This material improves the one that I presented in an R-Ladies Buenos Aires meetup in 2017.
