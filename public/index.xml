      <description>MotivationI started to develop ShinyApps because of my research. The development of a ShinyApp for the analysis of toxicological databases allowed me to explore the data in relation to different criteria.
Where to publish?After finishing the app, my first question was whether to publish the ShinyApp. Should I include it as supplementary material of other paper or could be published as software itself?
I got valuable suggestions in the RStudio Community forum including a list of possible journals accepting ShinyApps, in the following thread.</description>

      <description>Hello!In February I will participate in a meetup of the R-Ladies chapter R-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes and the R user group R en el NEA. These groups represent the R users of Resistencia and Corrientes cities of Argentina.
The meetup consists of a workshop where attendees will learn to build their own apps. This material improves the one that I presented in an R-Ladies Buenos Aires meetup in 2017.
